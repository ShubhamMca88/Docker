# Python Interactive Terminal App with Docker

This project demonstrates how to create a simple interactive terminal-based Python application using Docker. The app asks for user input and prints a greeting message.

## Project Overview

The project consists of a Python script (`main.py`) that runs interactively inside a Docker container. Docker is used to create a lightweight and portable environment for the app, making it easy to run on any system with Docker installed.

## Features
- Simple Python terminal-based application
- Interactive user input
- Dockerized environment for consistent execution across different platforms

## Files
- **`main.py`**: The Python script that takes user input and prints a greeting.
- **`Dockerfile`**: Defines the Docker image, environment, and commands to run the Python app.

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. You can download Docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
